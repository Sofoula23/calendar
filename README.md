# Calendar Project

This is a Day Planner that allows the user to plan their day by inputing information and saving it into the local storage. The saved information can be retreived from the local storage even if the webpage is refreshed. The application uses Moment js for the timeblock and changes color based on the time (past, present, future). The planner also displays the current date.
